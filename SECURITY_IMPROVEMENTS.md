# Security & Performance Improvements Summary

## Completed High-Priority Security Improvements

### 1. ✅ Removed SERVICE_ROLE_KEY from .env.local
- Created `src/lib/supabase/server-config.ts` for secure server-side configuration
- Updated `sitemap.config.ts` to use secure server config
- Service role key now must be set as environment variable on server only

### 2. ✅ Created middleware.ts for authentication and security
- Protects `/account/*` routes requiring authentication
- Blocks debug API endpoints in production
- Implements comprehensive security headers:
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY (prevent clickjacking)
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Content-Security-Policy with proper directives
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) in production

### 3. ✅ Secured debug API routes
- Debug endpoints automatically blocked in production via middleware
- Returns 404 for `/api/create-dev-user`, `/api/create-test-user`, `/api/toggle-email-confirm`

### 4. ✅ Implemented rate limiting with Upstash
- Created `src/lib/rate-limit.ts` using Upstash Redis
- Auth endpoints: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- General API: 100 requests per minute
- Applied to sign-in and sign-up actions
- Gracefully handles missing Upstash configuration

### 5. ✅ Added CSRF protection
- Created `src/lib/csrf.ts` for token management
- Created `CSRFToken` component for forms
- Updated sign-in and sign-up actions to validate CSRF tokens
- Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies with proper security settings

### 6. ✅ Enabled TypeScript and ESLint error checking
- Set `ignoreBuildErrors: false` in next.config.ts
- Set `ignoreDuringBuilds: false` for ESLint
- Fixed all ESLint errors
- Added experimental CSS optimization

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
- Fix TypeScript errors related to Next.js 15 async params

### Medium Priority
- Enhance password validation (complexity requirements)
- Add account lockout mechanism after failed attempts
- Implement XSS protection for user-generated content
- Add pagination for lists (templates, services, projects)
- Optimize data fetching with server components
- Add image optimization and lazy loading
- Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Implement proper error handling

### Low Priority
- Add caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## Configuration Required

For full security features, add these to your deployment environment:

```env
# Server-only (NEVER commit to repo)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Optional: Rate Limiting
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your-upstash-url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-upstash-token
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix TypeScript errors to enable build
2. Add the CSRF token component to all forms
3. Implement remaining security features
4. Set up monitoring for rate limit violations
5. Regular security audits and dependency updates
